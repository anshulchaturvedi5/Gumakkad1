      "Considered to be the oldest dance and an inspiration to all other styles, Bharat Natyam, a temple dance of Tamil Nadu, is an enchanting performance that relates scenes from religious texts and myths. In a series of quick and complicated neat motions, dancers dressed in vibrant attires and ornamented heavily from head to toe, execute moves that are a sight to behold. The continuously varying tempo and the stunning synchronisation of the dancers is a breathtaking sight.",
      "A dance-drama performance, native to Assam, Sattriya dance was created in the 15th century and has been a living tradition since. A regale of religious sagas, it is generally performed in monasteries, where the dancers dressed in stunning pat silks and adorned with traditional Assamese jewellery weave magic to the beats of cymbals, drums, flutes and even harmonium and violin.",
      "Manipuri dance, originating from the state of Manipur, is a spiritual experience that transcends art and seems more like a divine dance. Mostly revolving around Goddess Radha and Lord Krishna, this soft, mild and modest dance form sees dancers execute graceful and delicate movements to lyrical undertones. While the women are clad in a wrap-around skirt called sarong, the men wear a dhoti and a turban.",
      "Said to have introduced by the bards travelling around the regions of north India, Kathak involves the recounting of religious tales and legends in a rhythmic fashion. From tapping of feet and hand gestures to eye movements and facial expressions, Kathak leaves one reeling with wonder at the finesse and skill of the dancers clad in a long embroidered skirt, complemented with a choli (blouse) and chunni (a long scarf).",
      "A classical dance-drama native to the state of Kerala, Kathakali is believed to be almost 300 years old. It recounts the tales of the past, from epics, legends and myths, and while the dance and music resound with devotion, what really awes is the striking make-up of the dancers. The participants are clad in elaborate attires and don vibrant hues of make-up. Every flicker of the eye, twirling of the fingers or the quivering of lips has a special significance."
